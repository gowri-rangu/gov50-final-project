## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to climate change and wildlife migratory patterns/changes in wildlife populations. Another potential focus for my final project is the impact on recent anti-abortion laws in Texas. I would also like to study the perception of personal safety in public spaces between men and women.
